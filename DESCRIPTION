Title: Integrating Multi-Omic Network Data With Summay-Level GWAS Data
Version: 0.99.4
Authors@R: person("Luca", "Anholt", email = "la1317@ic.ac.uk", role=c("cre", "aut"))
Description: This pacakge integrates data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) 
    with summary-level genome-wide association (GWAS) data, such as that provided by the 
    GWAS Catalog or GWAS Central databases, or a user's own study or dataset, in order to produce
    biological networks, termed IMONs (Integrated Multi-Omic Networks). IMONs can be used to analyse
    trait-specific polymorphic data within the context of biochemical and metabolic reaction networks, 
    providing greater biological interpretability for GWAS data.
