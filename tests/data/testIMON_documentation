testIMON.Rds is an igraph IMON object created via inputting the Summary-level
GWAS data vector for estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer (EFO_1000649),
stored as an R data object. This data object is used purely for unit testing.

It was created by running the following:
library(PanViz)
data("er_snp_vector")
PanViz::get_IMON(snp_list = er_snp_vector,
                 progress_bar = F,
                 save_file = TRUE,
                 export_type = "igraph")
